      <p> Sid Meier's Civilization VI (called Civilization VI or Civ6 for short) is a turn-based strategy game in the Civilization franchise that was released in 2016. The lead producer of the game is Dennis Shirk, and the lead designer is Ed Beach. The game's first expansion pack, Rise and Fall, was released on February 8, 2018. </p>


<p>Every game in the legendary, 25-year-old Sid Meier’s Civilization 4X strategy series puts a new spin on the grand concept of taking a nation from a single nomadic tribe to a world-dominating superpower, one turn at a time. In that way Civilization VI looks familiar, but it’s loaded with some very smart and bold improvements that give it new levels of depth. Once I get absorbed into a campaign it becomes so engrossing it’s difficult to think about anything else.

Under its colorful, cartography-inspired art style and varied, stirring music that swells to accent what you’re doing and in what era you’re doing it, Civilization VI is crammed with an almost overwhelming number of systems. It’s got trade, it’s got religion, it’s got espionage, it’s got Great People, it’s got archeology, it’s got the kitchen sink. For the most part, that’s awesome because there are so many chances to build out your nation in different ways to take advantage of opportunities on its randomly generated maps and pursue the different victory types, and it’s all baked in at the ground level so that things like trade routes don’t feel tacked on and optional (they are, in fact, the only way to build roads in the early game). This feels like a Civ game that’s already had two expansions. (IGN)

    <p> It took Civilization V two full expansions to become the classic it’s regarded as today. Civilization VI is halfway there.


Civilization VI: The Kotaku Review
The trouble with reviewing a Civilization game is that they’re always good.

While my 2016 review of Civ VI was glowing, it did come with the historical reservation that Civilization games are so big, and their design process so ever-evolving, that they’re rarely a masterpiece from the get-go. So while Civ VI should be lauded for some of its positive steps, like the intricate district system and more flexible policies design, it also shipped with (relative to the series) poor diplomacy and some terrible AI.

Rise & Fall addresses some of these issues. But for the most part, the things it introduces aren’t interested in fixes; they’re instead looking at shaping your experience into something more intimate than you may be used to with a Civilization game.

There’s lots of new stuff on offer in this expansion, from UI tweaks to new factions, but I’m not here to rattle off bullet points. I’m instead going to be talking about R&F’s three main additions, and how they all work together to change the way each game of Civ VI feels. (kotaku)</p>
