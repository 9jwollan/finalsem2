<h3> Gamespot review</h3>
      <p>  With Firaxis' superlative Civilization III, that old-school, up-till-5am-addictive, and one-more-turn-based grand-strategy gaming that was introduced 10 years ago in the original Civilization is back. And it's back with a vengeance. This sequel to one of the greatest games ever, which was itself the sequel to one of the greatest games ever, lives up to its lineage. It is a paean to the principles of solid design, sleek interface, sharp artwork, unlimited replayability, open architecture, and epic storytelling. It is yet another example of Sid Meier and company's cunning insight into what makes games good. Civilization III is, in short, a triumphant proclamation that strategy gaming is alive and well and still able to keep you rooted in front of your computer for hours at a time.

Civ is back--and better than ever.
Civ is back--and better than ever.
There are two ways to look at Civilization III: either as it stands on its own, or as the most recent version in the evolution of a line of games stretching back to Sid Meier's original Civilization. As the latter, it's immediately clear that Civilization III's apple hasn't fallen far from the tree. In fact, you might even be disappointed when you start your first game of what feels like a warmed-over version of Civ II. But this feeling fades with time. The more you play, the more you'll realize that the new game's seemingly subtle changes have a significant impact.</p>

<h3>Rock Paper Shotgun review </h3>
<p>Civ III was the game that got me back into the Civilization series. Though, truth be told, I never got out of it – it’s just that the years without a new release happened to coincide with my time at university, where booze, unrequited crushes and PlayStation fighting games occupied almost my entire mind.

Even once I fell into a job which involved computer games, in its earliest years I was still clinging onto vague and misguided ideas of social acceptability, and so the big shooting game of the moment tended to be my main focus. When a colleague and friend took on the Civ III review and waxed lyrical about it, I openly mocked him for it. Civ was so nerdy. History? Turn-based? That’s so uncool, man. Never mind that most of my youth had been defined by playing historical and/or turn-based strategy games.

My mockery was water off a duck’s back. He was slightly older, and Understood. Instead, he passed me a copy of the game a few days later. Never one to turn down a free game at that early stage of my “career”, I took it home, installed and… Well, you know how this story ends. It’s how every story involving starting to play a Civilization game ends.

Civ III’s sort of the forgotten Civ. It didn’t start the series, it doesn’t have the infamy of the Civ II/Civ: Call To Power twin sequel rights argy-bargy, and it didn’t have the rapture that surrounded Civ IV’s double-whammy of 3D and meaningfully refreshing the formula. Civ III was the last of the classic Civilizations, and that means it carries a certain bunker mentality air of just trying to be an elaborate, slow and very, very computer game-y historical strategy title. There’s not even the slightest attempt to be, as my irksome 2001 self might put it, cool. And that makes me extremely fond of it, even to this day.
